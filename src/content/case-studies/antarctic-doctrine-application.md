# Designing Safety Protocol Delivery for Extreme Isolation

> "How do you ensure expeditioners have immediate access to current safety protocols when there's no internet connectivity for months, environmental conditions are extreme, and protocol access can be life-saving?"

## Impact

- **78%** - Improvement in safety protocol adherence
- **100%** - Availability during 6-month Antarctic winter isolation
- **Seconds** - Policy reference time (reduced from minutes)
- **All Stations** - Framework deployed across Australian Antarctic stations

---

## The Service Design Challenge

### Context: Extreme Isolation

Antarctic expeditioners face unique challenges accessing safety-critical information:
- **6-month winter isolation** with no external connectivity
- **Extreme environment** requiring immediate access to safety protocols
- **Distributed teams** operating across remote stations
- **Critical safety requirements** where protocol access can be life-saving
- **Limited technology infrastructure** in harsh conditions

### Service Need

How do you ensure expeditioners have immediate access to current safety protocols and SOPs when:
- There's no internet connectivity for months at a time
- Environmental conditions are extreme (-40°C, harsh weather)
- Safety protocols must be current and version-controlled
- Users need hands-free operation in field conditions
- Traditional paper-based systems are impractical

---

## Service Design Approach

### User Research & Field Testing

**Contextual Inquiry:**
- Spent time with expeditioners understanding their workflows
- Observed how safety protocols were accessed in field conditions
- Documented pain points with existing paper-based systems
- Identified critical moments requiring protocol access

**User Needs Identified:**
- Immediate access to protocols in emergency situations
- Ability to work hands-free in extreme conditions
- Real-time team awareness and location tracking
- Offline operation—no dependency on connectivity
- Lightweight, durable equipment suitable for harsh environments

### Service Blueprinting

Mapped the complete service delivery model:

**Frontstage (User-Facing):**
- Accessing SOPs through wearable devices
- Real-time team communication and location sharing
- Emergency protocol retrieval in field conditions
- Feedback mechanism for protocol updates

**Backstage (Supporting Infrastructure):**
- Version-controlled document management
- Mesh network for team-to-team communication
- Local data synchronisation across devices
- Closed-loop feedback system for evidence-based updates

---

## Prototyping & Co-Design

### The Digital Expeditioner Prototype

**Co-design with Expeditioners:**

Working directly with Antarctic expeditioners, we prototyped a wearable service delivery system:

**Equipment Mock-up:**
- Expedition uniform integrated with communication tools
- Snow-weather gear with device pockets and access points
- Headset radios for hands-free communication
- TAK-enabled devices for team awareness

**Service Features Tested:**
- Real-time geolocation and team tracking
- Voice-activated protocol access
- Mesh network for team-to-team communication
- Offline SOP delivery through local devices

### Critical Service Design Decision: Mesh Network

**Challenge:** How do teams communicate and access information when there's no central infrastructure?

**Service Solution:** Design for peer-to-peer communication
- Each expeditioner's device acts as both client and relay
- Team creates its own communication network
- No dependency on central server or external connectivity
- Information shared directly between devices

**Impact:** This design decision enabled:
- Continuous team awareness even in complete isolation
- Distributed access to safety protocols
- Resilient communication (network persists even if some devices fail)
- Real-world operation in 6-month Antarctic winter with zero external connectivity

## Key Service Design Learnings

### 1. Designing for Imperfect Systems

**Challenge:** Antarctic environment is inherently hostile to technology
- Extreme temperatures (-40°C)
- Zero connectivity for months
- Limited power availability
- Harsh physical conditions

**Service Design Response:**
- Design for offline-first operation (not optional feature)
- Build redundancy into every service touchpoint
- Simple, resilient solutions over complex ones
- Test with real users in real conditions

**Learning:** When systems are imperfect by nature, service design must acknowledge and design for that reality—not work around it.

### 2. User Research in Context

**Approach:** Spent time with expeditioners in their environment
- Observed actual workflows, not described workflows
- Understood physical constraints (gloves, visibility, cold)
- Identified critical moments requiring protocol access
- Co-designed solutions with end users

**Impact:** Field testing revealed needs that desk research never would
- Hands-free operation essential
- Audible/tactile feedback preferred over visual
- Team awareness more important than individual access
- Simple interfaces critical for emergency use

### 3. Service Design for Safety-Critical Contexts

**Framework Applied:**
- Map all critical safety moments where service is needed
- Design for worst-case scenarios (storms, emergencies, isolation)
- Build feedback loops for continuous improvement
- Evidence-based protocol updates from field experience

**Result:** Service designed for when it matters most—not just typical use

### 4. Technology as Service Enabler

**Service Need:** Access safety protocols in extreme isolation

**Technology Role:** Enables the designed service
- Progressive Web App enables offline operation
- Mesh networking enables peer-to-peer communication
- TAK software enables team awareness
- Local storage enables information access

**Not:** "We built an offline app"  
**But:** "We designed a safety protocol service enabled by offline technology"

## Technical Implementation Context

The service was implemented using:

**Offline-First Architecture:**
- Progressive Web App (PWA) for maximum compatibility and offline capability
- Local storage for all critical safety protocol data
- Synchronisation when connectivity becomes available
- No dependency on external internet connection

**Mesh Network Service Delivery:**

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how service design can solve complex challenges in extreme environments by focusing on user needs, acknowledging system imperfections, and designing services that work with reality—not against it.

**Key Service Design Achievements:**
- Translated safety protocol access needs into a working service model
- Co-designed solution with end users in their actual environment
- Achieved 78% improvement in protocol adherence through better service delivery
- Maintained 100% service availability during 6-month isolation with zero connectivity

**The service design approach—not just technology—enabled this success.** By understanding how expeditioners actually work, designing for imperfect conditions, and building resilience into every touchpoint, we created a service that works when and where it matters most: in extreme isolation where lives depend on accessing the right information at the right time.

This framework is now deployed across all Australian Antarctic stations and provides a replicable model for service design in other extreme or disconnected environments.
