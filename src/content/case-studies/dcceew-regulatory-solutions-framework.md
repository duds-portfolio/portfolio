# DCCEEW Regulatory Solutions Common Framework & Go-to-Market Strategy


---

> How do you standardise regulatory solution delivery across multiple programs while maintaining flexibility for innovation and reducing procurement time by 50-70%?

## Challenge

The Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and Water needed a standardized approach for delivering regulatory solutions across multiple environmental and climate programs. The challenge was complex:

**Fragmented Delivery:**
- Multiple regulatory programs operating independently
- Inconsistent approaches to digital transformation
- Duplication of effort across program areas
- No shared technology or service standards
- Varying levels of digital maturity

**Procurement Challenges:**
- Lengthy procurement processes for each new initiative
- Difficulty articulating requirements to vendors
- Inconsistent evaluation criteria
- Limited ability to scale successful solutions
- High transaction costs for small initiatives

**Strategic Needs:**
- Consistent user experience across regulatory services
- Reusable platform components and patterns
- Faster time-to-market for new regulatory solutions
- Better value for money from technology investments
- Clear vendor engagement model
