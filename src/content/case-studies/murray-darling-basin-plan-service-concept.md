# Murray Darling Basin Plan Service Concept


---

> How do you coordinate stakeholders across 5 states, balance competing water needs between agriculture and environment, and ensure compliance with Basin Plan regulations through unified service delivery?

## Challenge

The Murray Darling Basin Authority (MDBA) manages Australia's most significant river system, balancing complex environmental, agricultural, and community needs across multiple states. The Basin Plan required a comprehensive service delivery approach that would:

- Coordinate stakeholders across 5 states and territories
- Balance competing water needs (agriculture, environment, communities)
- Ensure compliance with Basin Plan regulations
- Provide transparent reporting to diverse stakeholder groups
- Manage complex data from multiple sources and jurisdictions

The existing service model was fragmented, with unclear touchpoints and inconsistent stakeholder engagement approaches.

## The Approach

## Approach

### Service Design Framework

1. **Stakeholder Mapping & Research**
   - Conducted extensive interviews with farmers, environmental groups, state agencies, local councils
   - Mapped complex relationships between 23 different stakeholder types
   - Identified pain points in current service delivery
   - Documented competing priorities and compliance challenges

2. **Service Blueprint Development**
   - Created end-to-end service blueprints for key Basin Plan processes
   - Mapped front-stage (stakeholder-facing) and back-stage (internal) processes
   - Identified critical touchpoints and failure points
   - Designed service interactions across multiple channels

3. **Co-Design Workshops**
   - Facilitated workshops with state water agencies
   - Engaged agricultural representatives and environmental groups
   - Validated service concepts through iterative prototyping
   - Built consensus on service delivery approach

4. **Service Concept Definition**
   - Defined clear service standards and performance measures
   - Created stakeholder engagement framework
   - Designed multi-channel service delivery model
   - Developed implementation roadmap with governance structure

## Solution

### Integrated Service Delivery Model

**Core Components:**
- **Stakeholder Portal:** Digital platform for Basin Plan information, compliance reporting, and engagement
- **Multi-Channel Engagement:** Coordinated approach across digital, phone, in-person, and community meetings
- **Data Integration Framework:** Bringing together water data from multiple state systems
- **Compliance Support Service:** Proactive assistance for water users meeting Basin Plan requirements
- **Transparent Reporting:** Public dashboards showing Basin Plan implementation progress

**Service Principles:**
- Transparency in decision-making and data
- Proactive stakeholder engagement
- Accessible information across all channels
- Evidence-based water management
- Collaborative approach across jurisdictions

### Strategic Value

**Service Design Clarity:**
- Comprehensive service blueprint covering 15 key service interactions
- Clear stakeholder journey maps for 8 primary user types
- Defined service standards with measurable performance indicators
- Implementation roadmap with phased approach over 3 years

**Stakeholder Alignment:**
- Achieved buy-in from all 5 state water agencies
- Consensus between agricultural and environmental stakeholders on service approach
- Clear governance model for cross-jurisdictional coordination
- Shared understanding of service delivery responsibilities

**Foundation for Implementation:**
- Business case for digital platform investment
- Technology requirements specification for stakeholder portal
- Change management strategy for service transformation
- Training and capability development plan for MDBA staff

### Long-term Impact

**Improved Coordination:**
- Framework for consistent service delivery across multiple jurisdictions
- Clear escalation paths for complex issues
- Standardised stakeholder engagement approach
- Better integration of state and federal water management

**Enhanced Transparency:**
- Public-facing service commitments and standards
- Clear reporting on Basin Plan implementation
- Accessible data for all stakeholder groups
- Proactive communication strategy

**Scalable Model:**
- Service concept applicable to other multi-jurisdictional programs
- Reusable frameworks for complex stakeholder engagement
- Lessons learned documented for future environmental programs
- Template for cross-government service design

## Key Learnings

### Complex Stakeholder Management

**Approach:** Used co-design to build shared understanding while maintaining clear trade-offs  
**Result:** Service concept that acknowledged complexity rather than oversimplifying

### Multi-Jurisdictional Coordination

**Approach:** Focused on common needs and flexible implementation across jurisdictions  
**Result:** Service model that works within existing state frameworks while improving coordination

### Evidence-Based Service Design

**Approach:** Extensive research, stakeholder validation, and pilot testing of concepts  
**Result:** Service concept backed by evidence and stakeholder consensus

---

## Methodology Applied

- **Service Design Thinking:** Human-centred approach to complex system design
- **Stakeholder Mapping:** Visual representation of complex relationship networks
- **Service Blueprinting:** Detailed mapping of service delivery across channels
- **Co-Design Workshops:** Collaborative design with diverse stakeholder groups
- **Journey Mapping:** User experience across multiple touchpoints and timeframes

---

## Technical Considerations

While this was primarily a service concept project, technical recommendations included:

- **Platform Requirements:** Specification for stakeholder portal with role-based access
- **Data Integration:** Requirements for aggregating water data from state systems
- **Reporting Tools:** Public dashboards using PowerBI or similar visualization tools
- **GIS Integration:** Mapping capabilities for Basin Plan monitoring
- **Mobile Capability:** Field access for water managers and compliance officers

## Client Context

**Murray Darling Basin Authority** is a Commonwealth statutory agency responsible for managing the Murray-Darling Basin's water resources in the long-term interests of the Australian community. The Basin covers over 1 million square kilometres across Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.

**The Basin Plan** is a legal instrument that sets limits on the amount of water that can be taken from the Basin's surface water and groundwater systems, ensuring a balance between environmental, social and economic needs.
