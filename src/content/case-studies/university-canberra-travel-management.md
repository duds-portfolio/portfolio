# Redesigning Academic Travel Services for Higher Education



> How do you make travel booking simple for busy academics while ensuring compliance with university policy, providing duty of care, and managing risk across diverse travel contexts?

## Impact

- **92%** - Positive customer feedback on redesigned service
- **28%** - Increase in digital booking conversion
- **45%** - Reduction in support enquiries
---

## The Challenge

### Context: Academic Travel Service Needs

For academics in higher education, international travel is essential:
- Fieldwork in remote locations (e.g., Papua New Guinea)
- Research presentations at international conferences (e.g., Toronto)
- Collaboration with international co-authors (e.g., Edinburgh)
- Visiting researcher programs
- Student field trips and study tours

**Existing Service Problems:**
- **Bureaucratic processes** creating friction for travellers
- **Inconsistent approaches** across different faculties and departments
- **Limited visibility** of who is travelling where
- **Poor duty of care** - difficult to respond to emergencies
- **Complex expense reconciliation** post-travel
- **Compliance challenges** with university policy and legislation
- **Risk management** issues for international travel

### Service Need

How do you design a travel service that:
- Makes booking simple for busy academics
- Ensures compliance with university policy and legislation
- Provides duty of care and emergency response capability
- Balances autonomy with appropriate approvals
- Manages risk across diverse travel contexts
- Simplifies expense reconciliation
- Enables faculties to support their travellers

## The Approach

## Service Design Approach

### Discovery Phase: User Research

**Stakeholder Interviews:**
- Academics (frequent and infrequent travellers)
- Faculty administrative staff
- Finance and compliance teams
- Risk and safety officers
- Travel support staff

**Process Mapping:**
- Documented existing travel booking workflows
- Identified pain points and delays
- Mapped approval pathways across faculties
- Analysed expense reconciliation process
- Understood compliance and risk requirements

**Pain Points Identified:**
- Booking process took 32 minutes on average (too long for busy academics)
- Inconsistent approaches across faculties created confusion
- Approval pathways unclear and slow
- Traveller location visibility poor (duty of care risk)
- Expense reconciliation manual and time-consuming
- Support enquiries high due to process complexity

### Service Blueprinting

**Created comprehensive service blueprint documenting:**

**User Journeys for Key Personas:**

**Academic Researcher:**
- Identify travel need (conference, fieldwork, collaboration)
- Plan trip and budget
- Seek approval
- Book travel and accommodation
- Complete pre-travel requirements (risk assessment, insurance)
- Travel
- Claim expenses
- Complete post-travel reporting

**Faculty Administrator:**
- Support academics with booking
- Process approvals
- Track faculty travel
- Manage budget
- Respond to emergencies
- Reconcile expenses

**Risk & Compliance Officer:**
- Assess travel risks
- Ensure policy compliance
- Track traveller locations
- Respond to incidents
- Report on travel activity

**Service Touchpoints Mapped:**
- Travel request and planning
- Approval workflow
- Booking process
- Pre-travel requirements
- During travel support
- Emergency response
- Expense reconciliation
- Post-travel reporting

### Design Principles

Established three core principles inspired by research ethics reform (3Rs):

**1. Replace:**
- Evaluate whether travel is necessary
- Consider digital alternatives (virtual conferences, remote collaboration)
- Explore local options before international travel

**2. Reduce:**
- Optimise travel frequency
- Combine multiple purposes in single trip
- Maximise efficiency and value

**3. Refine:**
- Improve trip planning quality
- Ensure clear benefits and outcomes
- Measure and learn from travel

## Service Design & Prototyping

### "Travel Odyssey" Co-Design Process

**Future State Ideation:**
- Generated multiple future service concepts
- Tested ideas with academic community
- Evaluated options against criteria:
  - **Coherence:** Does it make sense as a complete service?
  - **Confidence:** Will users trust and adopt it?
  - **Cost:** Is it viable and sustainable?
  - **Favour:** Does the community support it?

**Community Engagement:**
- Collaborative design sessions with academics
- Workshops with faculty administrators
- Co-design with support staff
- Iterative refinement based on feedback

### Prototype Development

**Service Implementation using Power Platform:**
- **PowerApps:** User-friendly booking interface for academics
- **PowerAutomate:** Automated approval workflows and notifications
- **SharePoint:** Data management for travel records, risk assessments, tracking
- **Integration:** Connected to university systems, travel providers, insurance

**Service Features Designed:**
- Streamlined booking workflow (reduced from 32 to 14 minutes)
- Clear approval pathways visible to user
- Automated risk assessment prompts based on destination
- Real-time traveller location tracking for duty of care

- Emergency response support workflow

### Pilot Testing

**Two-Faculty Pilot:**
- Tested with different travel patterns (frequent vs. occasional)
- Validated diverse travel scenarios (fieldwork, conferences, collaborations)
- Tested support processes and escalation pathways
- Gathered feedback and refined service
- Validated compliance and risk management approach

## Key Service Design Learnings

### 1. Co-Design with Community Creates Ownership

**Approach:** Involved academic community throughout design
- "Travel Odyssey" workshops generated future state concepts
- Tested ideas with real users before building
- Iterative feedback shaped service
- Community felt ownership of solution

**Impact:** High adoption (28% increase) because community designed it—not imposed on them.

### 2. Journey Mapping Reveals Hidden Pain Points

**Discovery:** Booking time only one issue
- Approval pathway confusion slowed process
- Pre-travel requirements scattered and missed
- Expense reconciliation disconnected from booking
- Duty of care poor due to lack of visibility

**Service Design Response:** End-to-end journey design
- Connected booking through to expense claim
- Integrated risk assessment into workflow
- Built-in traveller tracking for duty of care
- Streamlined as complete service, not just booking tool

### 3. Service Design Principles Guide Decisions

**3Rs Framework (Replace, Reduce, Refine):**
- Provided clear principles for evaluating travel needs
- Helped academics think critically about travel necessity
- Guided decision-making throughout service
- Created shared language for travel planning

**Impact:** Not just easier booking—better travel decisions and outcomes.

### 4. Technology Enables Service, Doesn't Define It

**Service Need:** Streamlined travel service with duty of care

**Technology Role:** Power Platform enabled the designed service
- PowerApps provided user interface
- PowerAutomate implemented approval workflows
- SharePoint managed travel data and tracking

**Not:** "We built a PowerApps solution"  
**But:** "We designed a travel service enabled by Power Platform"

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how service design—through user research, journey mapping, and co-design—can transform complex administrative processes into streamlined services that balance user experience with compliance and duty of care requirements.

**Key Service Design Achievements:**
- Redesigned travel service reducing booking time by 56%
- Co-designed with academic community creating ownership and adoption
- Mapped complete user journey from planning through expense reconciliation
- Improved duty of care through better traveller visibility
- Created sustainable service with community of practice support

**The service design approach—not just technology—enabled this success.** By understanding the complete travel journey, involving the community throughout, and designing for both user experience and institutional needs, we created a service that works for academics, administrators, and the university.

The travel service framework now supports academic engagement internationally while ensuring compliance, managing risk, and providing the duty of care essential for higher education institutions.
